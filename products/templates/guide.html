            <h2 class="guide-title">Step 1: Assess Your Needs</h2>
            <p>Before you start, take some time to assess your dietary needs, lifestyle, and goals. Are you planning for weight loss, muscle gain, or simply maintaining a balanced diet? Knowing your needs will guide your meal choices.</p>

            <h2 class="guide-title">Step 2: Set a Schedule</h2>
            <p>Determine how often you'll cook and which meals you'll plan in advance. Will you prepare every meal for the week, or just dinners? Setting a schedule will help you stay organized and committed to your plan.</p>

            <h2 class="guide-title">Step 3: Create a Balanced Menu</h2>
            <p>Ensure your menu includes a balance of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Use the plate method as a guide: half your plate with veggies, a quarter with protein, and a quarter with whole grains.</p>

            <h2 class="guide-title">Step 4: Make a Shopping List</h2>
            <p>Based on your menu, create a detailed shopping list. This will help you stay on track at the grocery store and avoid impulse purchases. Organize your list by sections of the store for a quicker shopping experience.</p>

            <h2 class="guide-title">Step 5: Prep Ahead</h2>
            <p>Once you've done your shopping, take some time to prep ingredients ahead of time. Chop vegetables, marinate proteins, and cook grains in advance. This will make cooking during the week much quicker and easier.</p>

            <h2 class="guide-title">Step 6: Store Meals Properly</h2>
            <p>Invest in quality storage containers that are both microwave and freezer-safe. Proper storage will keep your meals fresh throughout the week and prevent food waste.</p>

            <h2 class="guide-title">Step 7: Stay Flexible</h2>
            <p>Life happens, and sometimes you won't stick to your plan perfectly. That's okay! Keep some backup options like frozen meals or pantry staples on hand for those busy days when things don't go as planned.</p>

            <h2 class="guide-title">Step 8: Review and Adjust</h2>
            <p>At the end of each week, take some time to review your plan. What worked? What didn't? Use this information to adjust your approach for the next week, and gradually you'll develop a meal planning system that works for you.</p>
